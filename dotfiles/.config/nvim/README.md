# Le Neovim Config

Why hello there. This is my Neovim configuration. It's unnecessarily large and bloated ðŸ¤£

I also use it to learn the basics of Lisps. Check out the `fnl` folder for more. Fennel is a pretty dang cool language. Make sure you use it with Conjure by Olical! Makes it so much nicer to use.
